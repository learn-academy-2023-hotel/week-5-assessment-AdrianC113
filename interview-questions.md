# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What does it mean to implement a TDD workflow?

Your answer: A Test Driven Development workflow is the process of first creating a test in order to keep in line with the required output before actually writing the code. This allows the developer to focus on writing a code that passes a specific required outcome. 

Researched answer: A Test Driven Development workflow allows the developer to think about all aspects of the code before going into creative mode. Although it slows down the process, the testing will effectively make the code cleaner as it will avoid "creeping" code, in order words, code that isn't necessary but is later added due to the "just one more" thought process. It acts as a guideline for developers and synchronously providing pseudo code to help other developers understand the intent.  

2. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

Your answer: A relational database is a 2 dimensional table similar to a spreadsheet that can house information that a developer stores in it. The developer or user can then call for the data from the spreadsheet depending on specific quiries. Excel and Google Sheets are other kinds of databases.

Researched answer: Based on a proposal by E.F. Codd in the 70's called the rational model, Relational Database is used to organize data in a table format with rows and columns, similar to excel or google sheets. Relational Database connects information or data using keys which allows developerrs to invoke the information in a Database system like Ruby on Rails. Other kinds of databases are Oracle, Microsoft SQL server, and Snowflake. Users can reorganize or manipulate the database to return a set of data that fits their requirement. 

3. What is an ORM?

Your answer: ORM is a translator between Object Oriented Programming and Relational Databases. It lets a developer code in one program and have it automatically translated in to another. 

Researched answer: Object-Relational Mapping is a system in which CRUD or Create, Read, Update, and Edit is used on an Object Oriented Program in a rational database. ORM acts like a translator between different programming langauges. Due to its compatibility to objects or database structure, this allows developers to easily read or maintain databases within their program.

4. STRETCH: What is the difference between inheritance in JavaScript and inheritance in Ruby?

Researched answer: The difference between inheritance in Javascript and inheritance in Ruby is that Javascript uses a prototypal inheritance. This type of inheritance lets objects inherit directly from other objects. In Ruby, inheritence is supported by two classes, super and sub (parent and child classes, respectively.)

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Model validations: Model Validation acts as a filter to catch any invalid code saved in a database. It maintains the integrity of the code and outputs an error should an erroneous code be writtten within it. This also ensures that data stored within the database itself is maintained and meets the specific requirements. 

2. Params: Params or parameters, are information set by the developer to pass through a function in order to return a value. 

3. API: The Application Programming Interface is a tool that sends information from a website or app to the user. It acts like messenger and tells the system what it should do. Instructions can be transferred from a direct connection or through
